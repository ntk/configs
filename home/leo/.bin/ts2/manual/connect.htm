<p class=kop-3>Connect</p>
<p class=kop-3-p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=standaard><img src="connect.gif" width="511" height="581" align="right">In 
  order to speak with your friends or colleagues you need to connect to a server 
  (which has to be set up before connecting to it; see the server manual). Open 
  the menu “Connection” and press “Connect”.<br>
  Your local addressbook is still empty but we are going to add a server here. 
  Press your right mouse button in the white left section and click on “Add server”. 
  You can name the server anything you like. After that “Label” shows your previous 
  chosen name. Now fill in the Server address in the specified field, this may 
  either be an i.p. number (like 127.0.0.1) or a name (voice.teamspeak.org:9500). 
  The port of the server usually doesn&#8217;t need to be filled in. However if 
  the server host is running multiple server you can specify the port where it 
  needs to connect to behind the server addres with :portnumber (like in the name 
  example) After that you can choose a nick in “Nickname”. You are obligated to 
  fill one in unless you checked the “allow server to assign nickname” box in 
  which case you will get a name like “guest01”.<br>
  If the server is password protected you need to fill the appropiate one in at 
  the “Password” field. If you are bugged by time-outs (unwanted disconnects from 
  the server) check the “Auto-reconnect” button.<br>
  If you have <a href="registerwithserver.htm">registered</a> with the server 
  before you can optionally fill in your Login Name and Password (Important: do 
  not fill in anything if you haven&#8217;t registered with the server before!). 
  Remember to check “Registered” and fill in some Nickname!. You may even fill 
  in your favorite channel or subchannel you wish to connect to (optionally fill 
  in the password to the sub-channel if required). After that hit the “Connect” 
  button at the bottom. If all went well you are now connected to the server. 
  You should see your name with a green light next to it. </p>
<p class=standaard>You can add as many servers in your local addres book as you 
  want. They will be stored automatically. “Cancel” cancels the window.</p>
<p class=standaard>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=standaard>The Connect to server has another tab called “Web server list”. 
  In this tab all the servers are listed that have their server designated as 
  public servers. If you want to connect to one of those server just highlight 
  the server of your choice by clicking on it and then click the “Connect” button 
  below in the window. You can easily add this server to your local address book 
  by highlighting the server and click on the “Copy to local Addressbook” button. 
  <br>
  If a server was created while you already opened the Web server list you can 
  hit the “Update” button in order to have the list refreshed and have the most 
  recent list. “Cancel” cancels the window.</p>
<p class=standaard>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=standaard>Another way to connect to a server is via a webbrowser. The 
  way to do it is as follows:<br>
  teamspeak://serverdnsorip/ or teamspeak://serverdnsorip:ipport/<br>
  The parameters in the link are: nickname, loginname, password, channel, subchannel, 
  channelpassword and should be separated by: ? . I understand this looks like 
  it takes a nice afternoon of trying but I&#8217;ll give a nice example here 
  which will clear things up. Let&#8217;s take a imaginitive person called Major 
  Pain. He wants to login to his server (it.wasnt.me.com) as admin (password: 
  Ir0x0rz). He has a favorite channel called Chat Channel on this server which 
  is passworded (membersonly). Now here we go for the webbrowser link: <img src="linkbar.gif" width="785" height="26"></p>
<p class=standaard> When finished filling this in in the address or location bar 
  of your favorite webbrowser hit enter and TeamSpeak will start up automagically 
  and log you in according to the parameters given. Note that you do not have 
  to enter all this information if you just want to connect to a server via your 
  webbrowser. Just the DNS or ip will do to log in to a server as a guest.</p>
