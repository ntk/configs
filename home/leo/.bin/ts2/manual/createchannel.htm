<p class=kop-3>Create Channel</p>
<p class=standaard>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=platte-tekst><img src="createchannel.gif" width="335" height="375" align="right">If 
  the server has granted you sufficient privileges, either the server-flag “all 
  can create channels” is on (you check that in the Connection menu, <a href="serverconnectioninfo.htm">Server 
  Connection Info</a> under Server Options or right-click the servername in the 
  left section of the client and click on Server Connection Info in the popup 
  menu) or you are “SA” Server Admin, you can create channels on the server. After 
  clicking the menu item you are presented with a dialogue window. You must fill 
  in a name for a channel. You optionally choose a Topic for your channel (which 
  will show up in the right section of the all the clients connecting to your 
  channel). If you want to allow only privileged persons in your channel you may 
  set a password on it. Each channel you create can use a different codec, choose 
  a codec that suits your needs (this is mainly a bandwidth issue, for example 
  if the host the TeamSpeak server is on has lots of bandwidth you can chose one 
  of the GSM codecs; if the host has a DSL connection with 256 kilobit upstream 
  and he needs to host more than 14 people than you might be better off using 
  one of the CELP codecs, more information in this <a href="usedcodecsandsomewordsaboutquality.htm">this</a> 
  section). In the description area you can type a message to your channel vistitors 
  what your channel is about or maybe the latest news (it is restricted to 100 
  characters). In the Max. Users box you can set the maximum users you want to 
  allow to your channel. At flags you can check wether you want your channel to 
  be Registered (which means it will stay on the server permanently, otherwise 
  the channel will disappear after the last person leaves that specific channel). 
  If you check the moderated box only users that have specifically been given 
  <a href="voice.htm">voice</a> can talk in your channel, all others can listen 
  only. Voice can be given by persons with <a href="serveradmin.htm">Server Admin</a>, 
  <a href="channeladmin.htm">Channel Admin</a> and <a href="operator.htm">Operator 
  status</a>.</p>
<p class=platte-tekst>If you check Sub-Channels box, sub-channels are allowed to be created under your channel. This comes in handy when you have big teams in games which would communicate more efficient if broken up in groups. If you check the Default box your channel becomes the default channel which means that it is the first channel people come into when logging into your server (of course if they haven&#8217;t specified a channel while connecting). When you&#8217;re done with all the options you can press the Create Channel button to make the channel or Cancel to cancel the channel.</p>
