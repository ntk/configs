  The serveradmin will see all information. Highlight a person and click on Get

  Client Platform, Player Privileges, the current channel the player is in and 
  what flags the player has. In the Connection Info section you can see some information 
  related to the players connection. It says for how long a player is connected 
  to the current server, for how long the player hasn&#8217;t said anything at 
  the Idle line, the ping to the server, the packetloss the person is experiencing, 
  if you are admin the IP of the persons below your status is shown (otherwise 
  it says hidden), and the packets and bytes lines show how much traffic is generated 
  to and from the server. By clicking Ok the window will be closed.</p>
