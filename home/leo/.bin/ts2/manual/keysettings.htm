<p class=kop-3-p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=platte-tekst><img src="keybindings.gif" width="546" height="331" align="right" name="Keybindings">Teamspeak 
  comes with a very versatile and sophisticated system of binding options to certain 
  keys so you have maximum controle over TeamSpeak without actually having to 
  enter the program itself. <br>
  To bind keys go to the Settings Menu and choose Key Settings.You will now enter 
  the window &quot;Keybindings&quot; (top picture) where you can actually bind 
  functions to keys on your keyboard. To bind a function to a key press &quot;add&quot; 
  and you will be presented with the dialogue &quot;Define keybinding&quot; (bottom 
  picture). You can import keybind files other people have made with the &quot;Import&quot; 
  button. Of course someone has to have made keybindings before and must have 
  send the file to you. It ends with the extension: *.kbn. If you want to save 
  your keybinds to a file (TeamSpeak 2 automatically saves your keybinds made 
  to keybinds.kbn) different than the default one, press the &quot;Export&quot; 
  button and choose a name and place to save it to.</p>
<p class=platte-tekst>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=platte-tekst>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=platte-tekst><img src="definekeys.gif" width="434" height="303" align="right">In 
  this dialogue you can start making your keybinds. You can bind single keys or 
  make a combination by setting them. You can make combinations up to three keys 
  at a time. After you have chose a key or combination of keys you can chose the 
  action you want to bind to that key. The first action is &quot;Whisper to&quot;. 
  With this action you can talk exclusively to persons on the server (they can 
  only hear you, no-one else). With Whisper to Player list you can whisper to 
  one or more persons. Highlightboth the options and choose a person to add from 
  the dropdown menu &quot;Player to add&quot;, then press add. If you want more 
  persons then just repeat this until all the persons you want to whisper to are 
  in the right window. After that press &quot;Ok&quot;.</p>
<p class=platte-tekst>You can also whisper to one or more complete channels with 
  the Whsiper to Channel list. Highlight them both and choose a channel from the 
  dropdown menu &quot;Chan. to add&quot;, press add to add the channel. If you 
  want more Channels to whipser to at once then add more. They appear in the right 
  window. When done adding, press &quot;Ok' to make the bind. </p>
<p class=platte-tekst>The whisper to Channel pre-defs let's you whisper to the 
  parent channel you're in regardless of the names of the channels (e.g. let's 
  say you are in channel 1 and you have a subchannel 1.1 in which you are located 
  you can whisper to channel 1). With the Whisper to Channel pre-defs Subchannel 
  you can whisper to all the subchannels of the parent channel you are in (e.g. 
  you are in channel 1 and you'll whisper to subchannel 1.1, 1.2 etc.). This function 
  doesn't work if you are in a subchannel yourself. With the Whisper to Channel 
  pre-defs Channel family option you will whisper to both the parent channel and 
  all of the subchannels regardless if you are in a subchannel or parent channel. 
</p>
<p class=platte-tekst> If you want to communicate with the <a href="channelcommander.htm">Channel 
  Commanders </a>on the server you can bind to whisper to all the Channel Commanders 
  on the server, all the Channel commanders in the subchannels of your current 
  parent channel, all the Channel commanders in the parent channel, all the Channel 
  commanders in the channel you are currently in (own channel) and the all Channel 
  commanders in the parent channel and subchannels of that parent channel.</p>
<p class=platte-tekst>The Whisper to Preset function is a very complicated one. 
  It involves the &quot;Bind&quot; function as well so I will describe that one 
  in this section too. When someone whispers to you and you want to whisper back 
  to them but you haven't made a bind for that you can bind it to a preset by 
  pressing a button. This is what you do: Choose a key you want to bind. Then 
  go to Bind Last whisperer to and choose a preset (from 0 to 9). Now if someone 
  whispers to you, you can press that key. In other words the last person to whisper 
  to you has been set to Preset N. Now you can bind a Whisper to Preset key. Choose 
  a key and highlight Whisper to Preset and choose a preset number. Press &quot;ok&quot; 
  when done. Now this is how it works: Someone whispers to you. You press the 
  key you designated to Bind Last whisperer to preset N. After that you can press 
  the Whisper to Preset N and you will whisper to the last person that whispered 
  to you without knowing their nick or having to bind other stuff. You can also 
  bind those two actions to one key which has some implications (think about it 
  and you will find it out yourself). </p>
<p class=platte-tekst>The &quot;Switch to&quot; action makes you switch to channels 
  or servers. You can bind a key to switch channels by highlighting the both and 
  then choose a channel from the dropdown channels menu next to it. It will show 
  all the channels on the server you are logged in. If the channel you want to 
  switch is passworded you can fill that in at the password field. You can also 
  swith to servers. Highlight both those options and a server list is shown in 
  the dropdown menu. It shows all the servers you have in the Local Address book. 
  It automatically copies all server specifics from the Local Address book so 
  you won't have to fill in stuff like passwords or nicknames here. You can also 
  bind keys to switch to the next channel or the previous channel. If you press 
  the keybind it will go from the parent channel through all the subchannels of 
  that specific parent and then to the next parent channel and its subchannels. 
  If the last subchannel of the last parent channel is reached it will switch 
  to the first parent channel again.</p>
<p class=platte-tekst>With the &quot;Toggle&quot; function you can toggle your 
  status according to all the things stated in the right window. It pretty much 
  explains itself and the statuses are covered in the previous chapters. </p>
<p class=platte-tekst>The &quot;Bind&quot; action is described in the &quot;Whisper 
  to preset&quot; section above here. </p>
<p class=platte-tekst>The Set Volume action sets the output volume louder or softer 
  or to a preset level. You can bind keys to make the output volume be set to 
  a certain level (e.g. 30 %) or bind keys to lower or up the output volume with 
  10%. Press &quot;ok&quot; button when you are done.</p>
