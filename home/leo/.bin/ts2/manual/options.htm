<p class=lijst-opsomteken-2-tab1 style="margin-left: 14.15pt;"><img src="optionssounddevices.gif" width="332" height="333" align="right">TeamSpeak 
  automatically detects what recording devices your computer has. They are listed 
  in the Settings --&gt; Options --&gt;Sound Devices under Device. Here you can 
  choose your preferred device. Try by trial and error what works best for you 
  (e.g. I found out that my headset and soundcard recording worked better than 
  my usb webcam recording) Note that if there are only 2 options there (one being 
  the “primary driver....”) it doesn&#8217;t matter which one you choose.<br>
  In this dialogue-box you can also see what kind of recording you are using. 
  There are two kinds of recording: Wave and Direct Sound. The first one generally 
  delivers the best sound quality and the latter the lowest latency (depening 
  on the quality of your soundcard). The default is set to Direct Sound. When 
  switching between those two it is sometimes needed to restart TeamSpeak (when 
  you get an error message) in order to get it working properly. <br>
  DirectSound has a slider which controls the sampling buffer size. When it is 
  to the utter left one has the lowest latency (one can hear eachother with the 
  least amount of timelag). When the slider is to the utter right you will have 
  the same quality and timelag as Wave recording. When people on your server complain 
  you are just sending “noise” but you can hear them fine, you are probably using 
  DirectSound. Try sliding the slider to the middle or right position. Most of 
  the times this seems to solve this problem (this problem occurs because not 
  all soundcards all capable of sampling really short bits of sound, with the 
  slider in the middle or right those samples are a bit bigger and hence solve 
  the problem). Note: Windows XP users are generally better off using wave recording. 
  W98 users should use DirectSound.<br>

<p class=lijst-opsomteken-2>&#8226;Tab Sound Notifications</p>
<p class=lijst-opsomteken-2>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=lijst-opsomteken-2-tab1 style="margin-left: 14.15pt;"><img src="optionssoundnotifications.gif" width="332" height="333" align="right">TeamSpeak 
  has an extensive set of sound notifications. They all are pretty much self-explanatory. 
  The volume slider on the right controls how loud these messages are played when 
  something happens. These sounds are completely adjustable. If you want to use 
  your own sounds here you just choose and event fill in the file you want to 
  play (with the “...”button you can browse your computer for the file). You can 
  check wether the file is good by pushing the “Check File” button. If you decide 
  that the file is not good enough, you can revert to the default sound by pressing 
  the “Default” button.<br>
  If you are annoyed by all these event sounds you</p>
<p class=lijst-opsomteken-2-tab1 style="margin-left: 14.15pt;"> can check the 
  “Disable all sounds” box. </p>

  can try disabling direct input when you are experiencing troubles with keybinds 
  ingame. If you don&#8217;t want to be “whispered&#8217; at you can check the 
  &quot;Block Whispers by default&quot; box. You can set a Default guest nickname, 
  this is handy when you connect to a server using the webbrowser login (e.g. 
  teamspeak://my.server.com).<br>
  You can choose wether you want an icon in the traybar by checking the box. If 
  you are experiencing “choppy” sounds while playing a game (e.g. when your harddisk 
  shows some activity) set the Process Priority to High and restart TeamSpeak. 
  If all went well you shouldn&#8217;t experiencing those choppy sounds anymore.

<p class=platte-tekst style="margin-left: 14.2pt;">If you are the owner of a GameVoice 
  puck you can use it but you will have to enable: Enable GameVoice hardware support. 
  If you do not have such hardware leave it unchecked. If you are experiencing 
  problems with TeamSpeak you can choose to have the client log all actions. Our 
  coders can take a look at the log if you post it on the <span class=hyperlink> 
  <a href="http://forum.teamspeak.org">TeamSpeak forum</a> </span> and might be 
  able to fix your bug or problem. We at TeamSpeak highly encourage you to do 
  so. The only way to make this program even better is with your help and bug 
  reports.</p>
