  the output slider you can set the volume at which you want to hear TeamSpeak 
  at. In Teamspeak 2.0 there are 2 ways to communicate with your friends. The 
  first choice is called push to talk. This means that you have to press and hold 
  a certain button if you want to talk to others. The other way is by voice activation. 
  This means that Teamspeak will automatically transmit to your friends when the 
  program “hears” you talk. You can choose between the 2 voice send methods. If 
  you choose push to talk, select it and press the set button to bind a key.The 
  key you have chosen will now appear onscreen (here the NUM-LOCK key). Whenever 
  you want to transmit you have to press this button. If you want to use a different 
  button press clear and do it again. If you want Voice Activation, select that 
  option. Below that option you will see a bar voice activation level which you 
  have to configure for optimal sound. If you slide the bar to the far left Teamspeak 
  will transmit as soon as you make the slightest sound, even if you whisper, 
  chances are you will be transmitting to your friends all the time while you 
  don&#8217;t even know it. If you slide the bar to the far right you have to 
  scream before Teamspeak will actually transmit. <br>
  You can do a local test to check your settings and codecs. Choose a codec from 
  the menu and press Activate local test mode. When transmitting the green light 
  next to it will light up. The client will echo your spoken text. This function 
  is a good way to check your Voice Activation setting. When you are done click 
  the Close button to close the window.</p>
